This ResNet18 model has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet.

    "\n",
    "To facilitate training, the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK provides a high-level abstraction, the estimator class, which allows users to easily train their models in the Azure ecosystem. You can create and use an Estimator object to submit any training code you want to run on remote compute, whether it's a single-node run or distributed training across a GPU cluster. For PyTorch and TensorFlow jobs, Azure Machine Learning also provides respective custom PyTorch and TensorFlow estimators to simplify using these frameworks.\n",
